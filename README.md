### Problem 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2. Consider the following set of processes (for reference)with their arrival times and the CPU burst times in milliseconds.

Process	Arrival-Time	Burst-Time
P1	0	5
P2	1	3
P3	2	3
P4	4	1

Calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time for each process. The input for number of processes and their arrival time, burst time should be given by the user
